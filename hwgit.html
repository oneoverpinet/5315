      <h2>What is GIT? Why do we need source code Version Control System?</h2>
      <p> 
        GIT is a distributed source-code version-control system.   Instead of versioning at the file level like other products, it takes a snapshot and manages these to track the changes.   Files may be in one of three states, 1) Committed, 2) Modified, or 3) Staged. 

        Version Control Systems tracks this data in order to 1) revert to a previous state, 2) identify who made them and 3) compare changes over time.   Through these features, a team of developers can merge changes into a common version of the code.   This will also help troubleshoot problems which occurred new code was introduced.  The team can modify the state of various components to isolate issues.    These systems allow the flexibility of experimenting quickly and testing new code since it is easy to recover the previous state.  It can also help troubleshoot and isolate errors on teams since one developer may not be aware of changes made by others.

      <h2>Describe following terms: 1) local repo 2) remote repo 3) how to use GIT in Team Project – multiple developers work on the same project at the same time</h2>
     <p> 
      When using GIT on a team project, most of the time is spent on the local repository (“local repo”).  These exist on each developer’s computer and have file systems with a version to check out.  Once collaborating, members use the remote repository (“remote repo”) which is not for working on files and doesn’t have a working directory.  This is like a file server and could be either on an internal location or hosting service (like GitHub).
