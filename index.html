      <h2>What is Docker</h2>
      <p> Docker is a program which virtualizes the operating system through the use of containers.   This can be the right path for virtualization if on a single operating system (OS) – since all applications must be on the same OS as the base.   Since containers share the OS kernel, only one instance of the OS can run several applications.    They are also portable and can run atop virtual machines, increasing flexibility of options for the developer.  Also with a flexible business model, Docker has two versions including an open source which is free and downloadable. The largest concern overall for this method of virtualization is security threats which may occur when in close proximity to the OS.

      <h2>What is Nginx</h2>
     <p> Nginx is an open source web server with an event-driven design to deliver load-balancing when dealing with high traffic sites.  It differs from Apache-- which offers flexibility, but suffers slow page-load times at peak periods because a new process is required for each request.    Since Nginx is optimized for these spikes, it can handle four times the number of requests and maintain consistency and predictability.    It was acquired by F5 after offering a software solution to replace the hardware that regulated traffic flow in and out of applications.

      <h2>What is VM (virtual machine)</h2>
      <p> Virtual machines enable scalability without a dedicated, on-site physical machine.  These can be especially helpful for freelance developers who can leverage the cloud to scale out and balance loads at peak times.  The rewards occur because multiple instances of a virtual machine can be created -- each of which has the capabilities of a physical machine.  A virtual private server uses software, a hypervisor, to segment the physical server and keep the segments separate.  The best part is that the developer can rely upon a third-party to provide this computing power and easily adjust as needs change over time. </p>

      <h2>Who is Cloud Computing Service Provider - Digitalocean</h2>
      <p> DigitalOcean virtualizes the machine so that developers can host in the cloud and accommodate peak loads by scaling resources.    Private instances called “droplets” are setup by the developer to scale-out and adjust resources as needed.   This offers a great solution to consultants and projects that spike before moving to a more sustainable environment.    One benefit is that the service provides quick and easy “one-click” installation for applications.  One point of caution though, developers need to manage the cost and size of their efforts since DigitalOcean will keep feeding them more resources and charges to correspond with their droplet.  </p>
